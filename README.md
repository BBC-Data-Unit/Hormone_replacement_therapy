# Postcode lottery of menopause care revealed

In October 2022, we [revealed](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-62849438) a postcode lotter yin terms of how much money NHS Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) spent per woman aged 45-60 on common hormone replacement therapy (HRT) treatments.

Analysis of NHS prescription data shows some local health boards spent three times the amount per woman on Hormonal Replacement Therapy (HRT) than others.

Experts said the treatment options offered by some local health boards were "very limited".

The government said women's health was at the top of its agenda.
